# Travelhub
Project built by me during Junior Design Course (CSE-299). I have used flutter to develop this mobile app.
The main motivation behind this app was that people like to travel a lot and often in big groups, so when they visit different places in small groups it becomes very difficult to track each of them. This is when this app comes into use, it stores all the members info with their GPS coordinates and if they turn on live tracking all the other members can track each other in real time.
But at the moment the app is seperated into two parts. One part is for signup and login process where the information gets saved into database. I used Firebase for that. And the other part deals with the tracking which shows the user information with their GPS location and tracking features.
